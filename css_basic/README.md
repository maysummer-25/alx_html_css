# css_basic

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering HTML & CSS curriculum. It introduces the basics of styling web pages using external CSS files.

## Description

In this task, we copied HTML files from the previous `html_basic` project and added styling to improve their appearance. Two CSS files are used:

- `base.css`: Contains default styles to reset and normalize elements.
- `styles.css`: A custom stylesheet for writing additional styles (currently empty).

## File Structure

```
css_basic/
├── base.css        # Default CSS rules
├── styles.css      # Custom styles (empty for now)
├── index.html      # Home page HTML
├── tweets.html     # Tweets page HTML
└── README.md       # Project documentation
```

## How to Use

Open `index.html` or `tweets.html` in a web browser. Both files include links to the CSS styles:

```html
<link href="base.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Make sure these CSS files are in the same folder as the HTML files.

## Requirements

- All files end with a new line.
- No external libraries or frameworks are used.
- The code is W3C compliant and validates with the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
